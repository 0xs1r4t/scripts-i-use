read the docs - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

# some commands
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# create a user called "user" who can use docker without sudo privileges
sudo usermod -a -G docker user 
grep docker /etc/group # user
exit # restart system

# starter commands
docker run hello-world
docker ps -a
